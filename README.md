## Features
- **üîç Strength Assessment:** Evaluates passwords against multiple criteria, including:
  - Minimum length (at least 12 characters)
  - Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
  - Common password patterns
- **üö´ Leet Speak Detection:** Identifies and discourages the use of common leet speak substitutions (e.g., "3" for "e") that can weaken password security.
- **üìä Entropy Calculation:** Measures the randomness of passwords to provide a quantitative strength score, helping users understand the strength of their passwords.
- **üîê Breach Check:** Utilizes the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) to check if a password has been compromised in known data breaches, alerting users to potential risks.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Strong Password Generation:** Offers suggestions for generating strong, random passwords to enhance security.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **Regular Expressions:** For pattern matching and validation.
- **Hashing (SHA-1):** To securely check password breaches.
- **RESTful APIs:** For interacting with external services.
- **Command-line Interface:** For user interaction.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CYBER-MRINAL/PSSWD-Checker.git
cd PSSWD-Checker
python3 setup.py
```

## Usage

## Example
```
-->>Enter A Password To Check It's Strength: yourpassword123
-> Length Check: True
-> Complexity Check: False
-> Common Patterns Check: False
-> Leet Speak Check: True
-> Repeated Characters Check: True
-> Sequential Characters Check: True
-> Entropy: 28.5
-> Character Set Entropy: 56.0
-> Strength Score: 3

-->> The password 'yourpassword123' is Weak.
-> Password should include uppercase, lowercase, numbers & special characters.
```

## Future Enhancements
- **üåç Expand Common Password List:** Increase the list of common passwords for more comprehensive checks.
- **üñ•Ô∏è User-Friendly GUI:** Implement a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
- **üåê Multilingual Support:** Add support for multiple languages to reach a broader audience.
